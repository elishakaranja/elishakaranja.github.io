about_content: |
  I'm a passionate and curious software developer who loves building apps that solve real problems. Currently, I'm exploring the depths of Python and diving into React for building beautiful user interfaces.

  I thrive when turning ideas into interactive, user-friendly applications. Ask me about **APIs**, JavaScript, or how I turned a ticketing idea into a real app.

  In my free time, I enjoy reading about tech, helping friends debug code, and creating cool projects just for fun.

  Let's build something amazing together!
